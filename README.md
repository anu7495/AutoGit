# AutoGit
A command line script in node to perform various Git commands. The command gives output of git status, followed by git add all new modified files, and then commits them.
#HowToUse
Right now the script is under Developement but i will soon upload it on npm as a package.
To Use it right now, Clone the Repo and then go into AutoGit directory.                                                 
1. Make the index.js executable by using "chmod +x index.js" command.                                                   
2. Run "npm link" to create a link with your node install.                                                              
3. If npm link doesn't work, Use "sudo npm link".
4. Run npm install in AutoGit directory to install dependancies. 
5. To use the script, go to a git directory and type : autogit "your commit message".
